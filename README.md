I am currently pursuing a degree in CyberSecurity and will use this platform to collate other various projects, including walk-throughs, write-ups, and reports from numerous learning platforms, including TryHackMe and Hack the Box, as well as various CTF challenge spaces. In addition, I will be learning (as part of my curriculum) Linux, Python, and possibly Go, so I hope to use this to collect those projects. I am also completely new to using Github, and thus learning to use this platform as well.
